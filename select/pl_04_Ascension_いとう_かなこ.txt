Scheme, scheme,
ascension's breath,
ascension's breath
Lie, lie, as in a death,
in a death
Dreadful things have
now been done
Dead remains revealed by sun
Death by throat, the deepest cut
Blood from blood,
and blood for blood
Scheme, lie,
ascension, ascension
Lie, blood, ascension,
dead humans
Blood, blood, upon the blade,
on the blade
Fear, fear, untimely hate,
timely fate
Dreadful things have
now been done
Dead remains revealed by sun
Death by throat, the deepest cut
Blood from blood,
and blood for blood
Lie, blood,
ascension, ascension
Blood, fear, ascension,
dead humans
Curse, curse, upon you now,
on you now
Plague, plague, upon your soul,
on your soul
Dreadful things have
now been done
Dead remains revealed by sun
Death by throat, the deepest cut
Blood from blood,
and blood for blood
Curse, plague,
ascension, ascension
Plague, lie, ascension,
dead humans
Die!
